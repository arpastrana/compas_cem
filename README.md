# compas_cem

Constrained form-finding meets automatic differentiation.

## Getting Started

CEM is a geometric form-finding technique to create mixed tension-compression
structures. This **COMPAS** package is developed by Rafael Pastrana at the
CREATE Laboratory at [Princeton University](https://soa.princeton.edu/) in
collaboration Patrick Ole Ohlbrock and Pierluigi D'Acunto, from the Chair of Structural Design at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](http://www.schwartz.arch.ethz.ch/).

If you are curious about CEM's underpinnings, we refer you to these two
excellent resources:

- The [journal
paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010448519305342).
- The original Rhino/Grasshopper [CEM
implementation](https://github.com/OleOhlbrock/CEM/) by Ole and Pierluigi.

Additionally, feel free to check the
[examples](https://github.com/arpastrana/compas_cem/tree/master/examples/) to
get a first impression of what `compas_cem` can do for you.


## Installation

The preferred way to install `compas_cem` is to build it from source in only five simple steps.

First, create a new `conda` environment from your command line. The only
requirements are `python`, `compas`, and `rtree`.

```bash
conda create -n cem python=3.7 COMPAS=0.16.2 rtree=0.9.4
conda activate cem
```

We need to fetch `compas_cem` from this repository. Go to the folder where you want to store it and run the following. For example, if you are a macOS user and want to put it in the pre-existing `~/code/` folder:

```bash
cd ~/code/
git clone https://github.com/arpastrana/compas_cem.git
```

Next, Move into the the repository's folder (the one you've just cloned) and install `compas_cem` using `pip`:

```bash
cd compas_cem
pip install -e .
```

To double-check that everything is up and running, still in your command line
interface, type the following and hit enter:

```bash
python -c "import compas_cem"
```

If no errors show up, celebrate ðŸŽ‰! You have a working installation of `compas_cem`.

## Optional Dependencies

As a CAD-agnostic framework, `COMPAS` has `compas_viewers`, a standalone package to display 3d geometry from the command line. This is pretty
helpful when wanting to orbit and zoom around a form-found model without
resorting to a full-blown CAD software like [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/)
and [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/). 

Some of the examples presented depend on `compas_viewers` to display the
resulting form-found structure. However, the viewers package **is entirely
optional**, and is not required for `compas_cem` internals to work. If you are interested to, please follow the installation instructions provided
by the `compas_viewers` [repository](https://github.com/compas-dev/compas_viewers/).

## Link to Rhino / Grasshopper

There will be times when modeling a complex structure is easier to do with a few
mouse-clicks instead of a hundred lines of code. `COMPAS` enables connecting
`compas_cem` to [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/) and
[Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/) to access (almost) all of its
functionality from the inside.

To create the link, run the following snippet from the command line:

```bash
python -m compas_rhino.uninstall
python -m compas_rhino.install -p compas_cem compas_rhino compas_ghpython
```
