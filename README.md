# compas_cem

A **COMPAS**-flavored implementation of the Combinatorial Equilibrium Modelling (CEM) method.

![simple_bridge_optimization](./docs/images/simple_bridge_opt_4_fps.gif)


## Getting Started

CEM is a form-finding technique to generate mixed tension-compression, spatial
structures in equilibrium. This **COMPAS** package is developed by Rafael
Pastrana from the CREATE Laboratory at
[Princeton University](https://soa.princeton.edu/), in collaboration with
Patrick Ole Ohlbrock and Pierluigi D'Acunto, the CEM creators, from the [Chair of Structural
Design at the ETH Zurich](http://www.schwartz.arch.ethz.ch/). 

To best picture what is happening under the hood, we refer you to these three
excellent resources: the CEM's [journal
paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010448519305342),
the [condensed
notes](https://github.com/arpastrana/compas_cem/tree/master/cem_method.md) in
this repository, and to the [first CEM
implementation](https://github.com/OleOhlbrock/CEM/) created by the Ole and Pierluigi.

Additionally, feel free to check this [first
example](https://github.com/arpastrana/compas_cem/tree/master/scripts/01_hello_world.py)
to get a first impression of what `compas_cem` can do for you.

## Installation

The preferred way to install `compas_cem` is to build it from source in only four simple steps.

First, create a new `conda` environment from your command line. The only requirements (until now) are `python` version **3.7** and `compas` version **0.16.1**.

```bash
conda create -n cem python=3.7 COMPAS=0.16.1
conda activate cam
```

We need to fetch `compas_cem` from this repository. Go to the folder where you want to store it and run the following. For example, if you are a mac user and want to put it in the pre-existing `~/code/` folder:

```bash
cd ~/code/
git clone https://github.com/arpastrana/compas_cem.git
```

Next, Move into the the repository's folder (the one you've just cloned) and install `compas_cem` using `pip`:

```bash
cd compas_cem
pip install -e .
```

To verify that everything is running like a charm, still in your command line interface, type the following and hit enter:

```bash
python -c "import compas_cem"
```

If no errors arise, celebrate ðŸŽ‰! You have a working installation of `compas_cem`.
